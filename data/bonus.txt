Hypothesis of POIs

Assuming that:
- Requests are made by people when they are relatively close to where they live
- There is an equal chance for any person to make a request

Hypothesis:
- POI4 is situated somewhere more obscure than POI1/POI2 and POI3. This is because there are fewer requests made around
the area and it has a much higher standard deviation signifying that there is much more scattering of people around that
location
- POI3 is more likely to be situated somewhere that encompasses requests from multiple closer cities vs POI1/POI2
which seem to be more inclined to be a location with a wider spread of people
    - These POIs cannot be accounting only for requests within one city. This is due to the high average request
    distance being about 300km - 500km away from the POIs. It is further supported by the standard deviations also
    being relatively high.
    - For perspective, Toronto spans a maximum east-west distance of about 43km and north-south distance of 21km.
    300km is about the distance between the EQ Works office in downtown Toronto and Algonquin Park. With this being
    the average distance between a POI and a request, it is unlikely that the POI only represents requests for one
    major city
    - POI3 and POI1/POI2 both have roughly the same amount of requests assigned to them. However, POI3 has a smaller
    standard deviation around the average distance of its requests as well as a much higher density. We can conclude
    that POI3 could be situated somewhere with several cities or populations of people that are closer together, whereas
    POI1/POI2 is somewhere with the same amount of people over a larger area
